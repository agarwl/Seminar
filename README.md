### Adapting Deep Learning Models - Seminar Report
Learning quickly is a hallmark of human intelligence, whether it
involves recognizing objects from a few examples or quickly learning
new skills after just minutes of experience. One of the current limitations
of deep learning is the need for tremendous amounts of data.
Finding techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks
with orders of magnitude less data is a very active research area. 
  
In this work, done under [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/), we survey some of the recent approaches 
to tackle this problem of learning new concepts rapidly with very little data.
